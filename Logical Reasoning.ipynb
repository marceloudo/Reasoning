    "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a powerful library for natural language processing (NLP) in Python. It provides various tools, resources, and algorithms for tasks such as text classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, semantic reasoning, and more. NLTK is widely used in research and industry for NLP tasks and offers an extensive collection of text corpora and lexicons."

    "In logic, an argument requires a set of at least two declarative sentences (or \"propositions\") known as the \"premises\" (or \"premisses\"), along with another declarative sentence (or \"proposition\"), known as the conclusion. This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure. More complex arguments can use a sequence of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion, or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises which then act as premises for additional conclusions. An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic."
